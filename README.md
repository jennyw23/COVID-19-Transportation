## Looking at the Data
 I walk through my data collection, preprocessing, and analysis processes. The html files (which contain the original outputs of the data) can be viewed in human-readable ways using [this handy web app](https://htmlpreview.github.io/). Simply paste the GitHub file url into the search bar, and it will appear. I have also provided easy access through the below links:
