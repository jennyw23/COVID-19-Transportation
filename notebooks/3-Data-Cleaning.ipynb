    "## Motivation <a href name id=\"1\">\n",
    "Now that I have collected a sizeable amount of data, I want to clean some of the tweets that do not contain transportation relevant tweets which I found in PM2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another issue is that our transportation keywords captured more than just mobility/transportation tweets. The word \"line\" is found quite a bit, but rarely relates to transportation. For example, Guess this is the new party line cause it sure ain't this thing called \"truth.\" https://t.co/rkB5Gwzal4 uses the word \"line\" in relation to political party lines. My exploration into other files also shows that line is rarely used in the transportation context. Even so, I think it's more important to capture this word in case transportation tweets are found. We will handle any saved tweets unrelated to transportation after the initial data collection phase (during preprocessing).\n",
    "\n",
    "    From other files, it also appears that some of these tweets may be duplicates from the same individual. I noticed this especially on 1/24/2020. It's probably a good idea to do some filtering in case those are spam accounts or bots which could bias our analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this notebook, I will tackle this issue."
